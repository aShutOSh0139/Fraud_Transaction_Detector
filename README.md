# Fraud_Transaction_Detector
A Binary Classification Problem For Detection of Fraudulent Transaction in Bank. As a Solution RandomForestClassifier model is trained and tuned to attain  99% accuracy and 89% recall.

# Fraudulent Transaction Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning technique. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data,scales features and undersampling of unbalanced class.
- **Model Building**: Implements machine learning algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent- GPU accelerated RandomForestClassifier of CuML library is used to be 
                      trained on large dataset.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**:The Classifier is Fine tuned usng GridSearchCV and Custom tuning techniques for better performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides insights into model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
